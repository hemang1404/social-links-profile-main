## 🚀 My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Responsive design using `clamp` and viewport units
- Mobile-first workflow

---

## 💡 What I learned

- How to properly use `<a>` tags for navigation instead of nesting them inside `<button>`.
- Improved accessibility with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and semantic heading structure.
- Using `clamp` for responsive widths and sizes.
- Creating hover effects with smooth transitions and color contrast.
